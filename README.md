# KamiStats

KamiStats is a Python module designed to provide implementations of various statistical distributions, including but not limited to Binomial, Hypergeometric, and Poisson distributions. This library allows users to create instances of these distributions, calculate their probability mass functions (PMF), cumulative distribution functions (CDF), and other statistical properties such as mean, variance, and standard deviation.

## Installation

Instructions on how to install the necessary packages and set up the environment.

```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/kishimita/KamiStats.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd KamiStats

# Install the required dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage
Below are 3 examples of how to use the distributions of this module to calculate the probability mass function, cumulative probability function, mean, varience and standard deviation. For the rest of the distributions the code is self explanatory and has similar implementation as the ones in the example below. 

### Binomial Distribution
The BinomialDist class represents a binomial distribution.

Example
```python 
from distributions import BinomialDist

# Create a Binomial distribution instance
binom_dist = BinomialDist(n=10, p=0.5, q=0.5, k=5)

# Calculate the probability mass function
print(binom_dist.pmf())

# Calculate the cumulative distribution function
print(binom_dist.cdf())

# Get the mean
print(binom_dist.mean)

# Get the variance
print(binom_dist.variance)

# Get the standard deviation
print(binom_dist.std_dev)
```

### Hypergeometric Distribution
The HypergeometricDist class represents a hypergeometric distribution.

Example
```python
from distributions import HypergeometricDist

# Create a Hypergeometric distribution instance
hypergeom_dist = HypergeometricDist(N=20, n=10, K=5, k=3)

# Calculate the probability mass function
print(hypergeom_dist.pmf())

# Calculate the cumulative distribution function
print(hypergeom_dist.cdf())

# Get the mean
print(hypergeom_dist.mean)

# Get the variance
print(hypergeom_dist.variance)

# Get the standard deviation
print(hypergeom_dist.std_dev)
```

### Poisson Distribution
The PoissonDist class represents a Poisson distribution.

Example
```python
from distributions import PoissonDist

# Create a Poisson distribution instance
poisson_dist = PoissonDist(λ=4, k=2)

# Calculate the probability mass function
print(poisson_dist.pmf())

# Calculate the cumulative distribution function
print(poisson_dist.cdf())

# Get the mean
print(poisson_dist.mean)

# Get the variance
print(poisson_dist.variance)

# Get the standard deviation
print(poisson_dist.std_dev)
```
## Not for Use!
Any file in the test_scripts, and tests. This was used for unittest and due to files and folder struectures the code does not work.
